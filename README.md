# NodeJs + Bootstrap + Font Awesome

This boilerplate loads [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome 4](https://fontawesome.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) and more useful stuff.  
We included everything you need to start a small project from scratch.


## Installation

1. Download the boilerplate as .zip-file.
1. Extract the files and copy them to your project root.
1. Run ```npm install``` in your terminal to get all needed packages.
1. Copy __the variables.env.sample__ file to __variables.env__.
1. Run ```npm start``` to start the node.js application.

## Development &amp; Production mode

If you want to run the application in development mode, where webpack is watching for changes of SCSS and JavaScript files, etc. simply run the following command:  
```npm run dev```.

And for production mode use:
```npm start```

### Watching for changes

The __npm run dev__ command will recompile all SCSS and JavaScript files automatically using webpack, if changes are detected.
